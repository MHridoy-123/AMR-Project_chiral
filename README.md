Background: Chemical pollutants, including heavy metals, organic compounds, microplastics, and nanomaterials, present serious risks to both ecosystems and human health. Despite increasing awareness, there is still a lack of comprehensive understanding regarding their long-term effects, interactions, and strategies for mitigation, particularly in the context of changing environmental conditions.
Methods: A systematic review was performed by searching databases including ResearchGate, Google Scholar, PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. The search utilized keywords such as "toxicity," "water contaminant," "pathogen," "E. coli," "sustainable water," "drinking water," "water quality," "environmental impacts," "human health," and "aquatic animals." In total, 756 articles were downloaded, and a primary screening was conducted on 435 of these. Abstracts and results were thoroughly reviewed for 221 articles to ensure their relevance and quality concerning the objectives of the review.
Results: Heavy metals interfere with cellular signaling, trigger oxidative stress, and cause DNA damage, which can lead to chronic health conditions, including cancer. Organic pollutants function as endocrine disruptors, negatively affecting reproductive and developmental processes. Microplastics and nanomaterials worsen oxidative stress and inflammation, with evidence indicating bioaccumulation and organ-specific toxicity. While innovative remediation technologies show potential, their scalability remains a concern. The combined effects of natural and human stressors emphasize the need for integrated management approaches, including nutrient control, climate-adaptive strategies, and regulatory frameworks to mitigate the long-term risks of eutrophication and hypoxia in critical aquatic environments.
Conclusions: This systematic review underscores the critical necessity for interdisciplinary strategies to address contaminant risks. The implementation of effective policies, alongside the development of innovative technologies, is vital for the sustainable management of chemical pollutants. Future research should prioritize the long-term health effects, the interactions between various contaminants, and the creation of scalable solutions to safeguard both environmental and public health.
